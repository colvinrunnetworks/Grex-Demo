## Alteration for Grex ***
This project follows the general set up instructions that are set forth in the [demo setup](https://github.com/colvinrunnetworks/Grex-Demo/blob/main/docs/demo/README.md). However, this project has been altered to help show a table top demonstration of how Grex would work to authenticate and validate verifiable credentials through the blockchain. Because of this, the current demo repository runs with a few certain parameters. This current version utilizes agent communication ran locally, **Not In Docker**. The set up instructions found [in the demo tab](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/docs/demo/README.md) will help you set up the agents locally as well as set up any other dependencies needed. In addition to this demo running locally, it also relies on the use of BCovrin sandbox in order to run and not a VON network connection. 

You should utilize commands such as: ``` LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber ``` to run the agent with the BCovrin blockchain sandbox.

Some file names have been altered. In general faber.py = authorizing entity, alice.py = drone, and acme.py = ground control station 1. For the counter example where the drones do **not** connect, drone2.py and gcs2.py represent the drone and ground control station respectively.   

This demo is meant to represent the secure communication between the blockchain and Aries agents, one of which is represented to be deployed on a drone. For the full demo to work, a drone simulation must be set up and running to send commands. This demo was developed using the [Ardupilot SITL](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html) which **must** be running in order for the demo to work. There is a function in the [agent_container.py file](https://github.com/colvinrunnetworks/Grex-Demo/blob/main/demo/runners/agent_container.py) in the demo folder (line 622 and 623) which you must change the host and port number in order to connect to the correct port with the SITL. Although not required, this demo used QGroundControl to track the drone's route visually. The program can run without the Ground Station, but you will not see the drone actually move without it. 

This Demo also assumes the use of Python version 3.11. Either change the versioning or utilize a virtual environment in the terminal. You will run into errors without the correct version of Python running. 

**To run the demo** 

Ensure that the SITL is up and running. With the SITL, ensure you have exposed the correct ports and that you have altered the agent_container.py file to have the correct host ip and port number. You will get stuck in an infinite loop if you have the incorrect host ip address and port number. Once you are sure that it running correctly, you can optionally open QGroundControl. Assuming the SITL is configured correctly, the drone should appear on the screen with no extra alteration needed. 

You will need 3 terminals windows open. Change directories to the /demo/runners folder. Run each agent:
``` LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo faber ```  
``` LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo alice ```   
``` LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo acme ```  
Faber is your authorizing entity  
Alice is your drone  
Acme is your Ground Control Station  
(Hint: if you run into errors at this stage, make sure that you are running the correct version of Python needed by this repo)

The demo should be running at this point and you should be able to do the handshake as instructed. Connect the authorizing entity and drone, pass the verifiable credential from the authorizing entity to the drone. Connect the ground control station to the drone next. It should verify the verifiable credential without prompting. You should then be able to feed the drone flight instructions from the ground control station. This should complete the demo.

## Overview

Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for building Verifiable Credential (VC) ecosystems. It operates in the second and third layers of the [Trust Over IP framework (PDF)](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/toip_050520_primer.pdf) using [DIDComm messaging](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0005-didcomm) and [Hyperledger Aries](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries) protocols. The "cloud" in the name means that ACA-Py runs on servers (cloud, enterprise, IoT devices, and so forth), and is not designed to run on mobile devices.

ACA-Py is built on the Aries concepts and features that make up [Aries Interop Profile (AIP) 2.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-20). [ACA-Pyâ€™s supported Aries protocols](docs/features/SupportedRFCs.md) include, most importantly, protocols for issuing, verifying, and holding verifiable credentials using both [Hyperledger AnonCreds] verifiable credential format, and the [W3C Standard Verifiable Credential Data Model] format using JSON-LD with LD-Signatures and BBS+ Signatures. Coming soon -- issuing and presenting [Hyperledger AnonCreds] verifiable credentials using the [W3C Standard Verifiable Credential Data Model] format.

[Hyperledger AnonCreds]: https://www.hyperledger.org/use/anoncreds
[W3C Standard Verifiable Credential Data Model]: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/

To use ACA-Py you create a business logic controller that "talks to" an ACA-Py instance (sending HTTP requests and receiving webhook notifications), and ACA-Py handles the Aries and DIDComm protocols and related functionality. Your controller can be built in any language that supports making and receiving HTTP requests; knowledge of Python is not needed. Together, this means you can focus on building VC solutions using familiar web development technologies, instead of having to learn the nuts and bolts of low-level cryptography and Trust over IP-type Aries protocols.

This [checklist-style overview document](docs/features/SupportedRFCs.md) provides a full list of the features in ACA-Py.
The following is a list of some of the core features needed for a production deployment, with a link to detailed information about the capability.

### Multi-Tenant

ACA-Py supports "multi-tenant" scenarios. In these scenarios, one (scalable) instance of ACA-Py uses one database instance, and are together capable of managing separate secure storage (for private keys, DIDs, credentials, etc.) for many different actors. This enables (for example) an "issuer-as-a-service", where an enterprise may have many VC issuers, each with different identifiers, using the same instance of ACA-Py to interact with VC holders as required. Likewise, an ACA-Py instance could be a "cloud wallet" for many holders (e.g. people or organizations) that, for whatever reason, cannot use a mobile device for a wallet. Learn more about multi-tenant deployments [here](docs/features/Multitenancy.md).

### Mediator Service

Startup options allow the use of an ACA-Py as an Aries [mediator](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays#summary) using core Aries protocols to coordinate its mediation role. Such an ACA-Py instance receives, stores and forwards messages to Aries  agents that (for example) lack an addressable endpoint on the Internet such as a mobile wallet. A live instance of a public mediator based on ACA-Py is available [here](https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/) from Indicio Technologies. Learn more about deploying a mediator [here](docs/features/Mediation.md). See the [Aries Mediator Service](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mediator-service) for a "best practices" configuration of an Aries mediator.

### Indy Transaction Endorsing

ACA-Py supports a Transaction Endorsement protocol, for agents that don't have write access to an Indy ledger.  Endorser support is documented [here](docs/features/Endorser.md).

### Scaled Deployments

ACA-Py supports deployments in scaled environments such as in Kubernetes environments where ACA-Py and its storage components can be horizontally scaled as needed to handle the load.

### VC-API Endpoints

A set of endpoints conforming to the vc-api specification are included to manage w3c credentials and presentations. They are documented [here](docs/features/JsonLdCredentials.md#vc-api) and a postman demo is available [here](docs/features/JsonLdCredentials.md#vc-api).

## Example Uses

The business logic you use with ACA-Py is limited only by your imagination. Possible applications include:

* An interface to a legacy system to issue verifiable credentials
* An authentication service based on the presentation of verifiable credential proofs
* An enterprise wallet to hold and present verifiable credentials about that enterprise
* A user interface for a person to use a wallet not stored on a mobile device
* An application embedded in an IoT device, capable of issuing verifiable credentials about collected data
* A persistent connection to other agents that enables secure messaging and notifications
* Custom code to implement a new service.

## Getting Started

For those new to SSI, Aries and ACA-Py, there are a couple of Linux Foundation edX courses that provide a good starting point.

* [Identity in Hyperledger: Indy, Aries and Ursa](https://www.edx.org/course/identity-in-hyperledger-aries-indy-and-ursa)
* [Becoming a Hyperledger Aries Developer](https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer)

The latter is the most useful for developers wanting to get a solid basis in using ACA-Py and other Aries Frameworks.

Also included here is a much more concise (but less maintained) [Getting Started Guide](docs/gettingStarted/README.md) that will take you from knowing next to nothing about decentralized identity to developing Aries-based business apps and services. Youâ€™ll run an Indy ledger (with no ramp-up time), ACA-Py apps and developer-oriented demos. The guide has a table of contents so you can skip the parts you already know.

### Understanding the Architecture

There is an [architectural deep dive webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXTQEtB4fto&feature=youtu.be) presented by the ACA-Py team, and [slides from the webinar](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K7qiQkVi4n-lpJ3nUZY27OniUEM0c8HAIk4imCWCx5Q/edit#slide=id.g5d43fe05cc_0_77) are also available. The picture below gives a quick overview of the architecture, showing an instance of ACA-Py, a controller and the interfaces between the controller and ACA-Py, and the external paths to other agents and public ledgers on the Internet.

You can extend ACA-Py using plug-ins, which can be loaded at runtime.  Plug-ins are mentioned in the [webinar](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K7qiQkVi4n-lpJ3nUZY27OniUEM0c8HAIk4imCWCx5Q/edit#slide=id.g5d43fe05cc_0_145) and are [described in more detail here](docs/features/PlugIns.md). An ever-expanding set of ACA-Py plugins can be found
in the [Aries ACA-Py Plugins repository]. Check them out -- it might have the very plugin you need!

### Installation and Usage

Use the ["install and go" page for developers](docs/features/DevReadMe.md) if you are comfortable with Trust over IP and Aries concepts. ACA-Py can be run with Docker without installation (highly recommended), or can be installed [from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aries-cloudagent/). In the [/demo directory](./demo) there is a full set of demos for developers to use in getting started, and the [demo read me](docs/demo/README.md) is a great starting point for developers to use an "in-browser" approach to run a zero-install example. The [Read the Docs](https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) overview is also a way to understand the internal modules and APIs that make up an ACA-Py instance.

If you would like to develop on ACA-Py locally note that we use Poetry for dependency management and packaging, if you are unfamiliar with poetry please see our [cheat sheet](docs/deploying/Poetry.md)

## About the ACA-Py Admin API

The [overview of ACA-Pyâ€™s API](docs/features/AdminAPI.md) is a great starting place for learning about the ACA-Py API when you are starting to build your own controller.

An ACA-Py instance puts together an OpenAPI-documented REST interface based on the protocols that are loaded. This is used by a controller application (written in any language) to manage the behavior of the agent. The controller can initiate actions (e.g. issuing a credential) and can respond to agent events (e.g. sending a presentation request after a connection is accepted). Agent events are delivered to the controller as webhooks to a configured URL.

Technical note: the administrative API exposed by the agent for the controller to use must be protected with an API key (using the --admin-api-key command line arg) or deliberately left unsecured using the --admin-insecure-mode command line arg. The latter should not be used other than in development if the API is not otherwise secured.

## Troubleshooting

There are a number of resources for getting help with ACA-Py and troubleshooting
any problems you might run into. The
[Troubleshooting](docs/testing/Troubleshooting.md) document contains some
guidance about issues that have been experienced in the past. Feel free to
submit PRs to supplement the troubleshooting document! Searching the [ACA-Py
GitHub issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues)
may uncovers challenges you are having that others have experienced, often
with solutions. As well, there is the "aries-cloudagent-python"
channel on the Hyperledger Discord chat server ([invitation
